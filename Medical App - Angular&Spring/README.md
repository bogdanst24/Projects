# Medical Application 
Created by Bogdan Stupariu


The application is created for the third assignment of Software Designs' laboratory and uses the following technologies:
  - Database: MySQL Workbanch
  - Backend: Java 1.8, Spring Boot, Maven, JDBC
  - Frontend: Javascript, AngularJS (1.7), Bootstrap

> This is a client-server application for managing the consultations of doctors in a clinic. The application has three types of users: the clinic secretary, the doctors and an administrator.


## How to run the application


##### 1. Run the application online. 
This feature is possible by uploading both the back and front side on a server (or two). 
- The backend should be run on a virtual server with the port setted to localhost address port 8080.
- The database should be imported in an online database context (eighter on a cloud service, web hosting or other possible ways) alongside with changing the access settings from the application properties in the backend side. The address and port should be changed in order to match with the new setted ones.
- The frontend should be uploaded on a server. In order to make the requests to the backend work, the address should be updated to the new context. The settings are defined in the app.js file, under the API_URL constant as an address link.

**The backend is created in Java, so be sure to find a web hosting / cloud service that supports Java Hosting!**

##### 2. Run the application on a local machine

**Backend and Frontend components**
Clone git repository: 
```sh
$git clone https://github.com/SD-PS2017/30432-a3-bogdanstupariu.git
```

 Download and install the latest version of the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (Java SE 6 Update 27). Note the installation directory for laterâ€”probably something like 
 ```sh
 C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_27\bin.
```
To make sure that Windows can find the Java compiler and interpreter:
Select Start -> Computer -> System Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables -> System variables -> PATH.
- [ In Vista, select Start -> My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System variables -> PATH. ]
- [ In Windows XP, Select Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System variables -> PATH. ]

Prepend 
```sh
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_27\bin; 
```
to the beginning of the PATH variable.
Click OK three times.

Launch the command prompt via All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt.
From the Command Prompt, navigate to the directory containing your .java files, say
```sh
C:\introcs\hello, by typing the cd command below.
C:\Users\username>cd c:\30432-a3-bogdanstupariu\medapp_back\
C:\30432-a3-bogdanstupariu\medapp_back\>
```
Assuming the file, Main.java, is in the current working directory, type the javac command in boldface below to compile it.
```sh
C:\30432-a3-bogdanstupariu\medapp_back\>javac \src\main\java\com\stupariu
```
From the Command Prompt, type the java command below
```sh
C:\30432-a3-bogdanstupariu\medapp_back\>java \src\main\java\com\stupariu
```
